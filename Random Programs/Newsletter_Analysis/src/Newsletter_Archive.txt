DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN
IBM and Maersk are using a blockchain built on the Hyperledger Fabric to manage the supply chain for container shipping. Ramesh Gopinath, IBM’s vice president of blockchain research, said all the documents for shipping containers can be fully digitized and the containers can be tracked. In the September POC, the shipping cost $2,000 and the paperwork could be about $300, or 15 percent of the cargo’s value. Traditionally, a simple shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations, including more than 200 different interactions and communications among them, said the IBM announcement. Using digital records and a blockchain can sharply reduce costs, although the actual savings won’t be known for a year or two until the blockchain is more widely used.

The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (Tukes) is developing a national online database of chemicals to bring information on substances into one place. The KemiDigi project will enable companies to handle chemicals with reporting obligations through a single service, after which the information will be available for others who need it.The database will reduce workloads for businesses and allow authorities to have a direct control on risk assessment. The project will start piloting in small 'blocks' at the end of 2017 with full operations scheduled for 2020. Initially the database will be limited to hazardous chemicals. Later, it will be possible for companies to maintain lists of chemicals for emergency and employment protection needs. Discussions are ongoing about the type of information that should be collected, who should use the system and the conditions under which information may be used, the agency says. It is consulting representatives of public authorities and businesses.

The world recycles just 14% of the plastic packaging it uses. Recycling the remaining 86% of used plastics could create $80bn-$120bn in revenues, says a recent report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. But those revenues will never be fully achieved without designing new ways to breakdown and reuse 30% (by weight) of the plastic packaging that isn’t recycled because the material is contaminated or too small for easy collection, has very low economic value or contains multiple materials that cannot be easily separated. The market opportunity has attracted small, young companies like Agylix, BioCellection, Saperatec and Cadel Deinking that focus on developing recycling technology to tackle that troublesome 30% of plastic packaging.

A University of Glasgow research project could help future space explorers create their own chemicals and drugs on demand, allowing them to maximise the efficiency of their launch payloads by taking raw chemicalingredients with them rather than specific medications. They could then use digital chemistry technology to make drugs and other materials as required.‌‌ A DIDO2 nano-satellite containing an experiment designed by Professor Lee Cronin, the University's Regius Chair of Chemistry, was one of 103 launched into space on an Indian rocket. The experiment is a continuation of previous research from the Cronin Group which aims to digitise chemistry and make it possible for chemical compounds of all kinds to be 'printed' on demand.

After the city of Flint, Michigan, temporarily switched water sources in 2014, residents began to develop unusual medical conditions. The city later learned the water was contaminated with high levels of lead and other toxins. In the future, we could use blockchains to avoid the kind of uncertainty and misinformation that caused so much damage to the Flint community. Blockchain technology could be rolled out as part of a two-layer system: one layer for collecting supply-line data in real time and the other for securing and making the data available to stakeholders. This hybrid of IoT and blockchain would of course have many more use cases beyond water management. To name just one other example, the same system could be used to improve the monitoring of oil pipelines. To date, supply-line organizations are showing little or no interest in blockchain tech. But as customers and communities apply increasing pressure for gas and oil pipelines that don’t leak and pollute, clean water, and industrial food and beverage facilities that accurately monitor contamination, we could see a shift towards implementing blockchain technology.

Karthik Sridharan, CEO of the SMB procurement platform Kinnek shared insights on the challenges and opportunities that lie in bringing small business owners together with suppliers: “For any marketplace, you have to worry about preventing people from going around you, while also explicitly doing things to make sure that buyers and suppliers want to stay on the platform. What we always think about for our platform is that, even in the case of a buyer that has a supplier they would never switch from, we need that buyer to want to use Kinnek for managing that relationship. It’s a tricky product challenge, but I think we’ve made it work by doing several things. One is that suppliers really care about the reputational ecosystem, so if the Kinnek marketplace is an increasingly important source of business for a supplier, then they want those interactions to be through Kinnek.”

Alchemist Accelerator has raised $2 million from GE Digital to start a new program for industrial IoT startups. In the past, enterprise hardware and software startups were seen as capital intensive, with the challenge of long sales cycles. That made them less appealing to early-stage investors. But VC’s at every stage appear more interested in enterprise tech these days as sensors, wearables, robotics and autonomous vehicles are transforming industrial sectors. GE Digital Vice President and CFO Khozema Shipchandler, who oversees the group’s merger and acquisition activity, said his firm intends to participate in follow-on investments in promising companies from the accelerator’s new track, and may possibly acquire some companies or partner with others. Last year, GE acquired Alchemist alumni Wise.io, so there’s precedent for serious deal making. Shipchandler said, ”As the industrial internet plays out it’s not 100% clear which technologies will win. We’re thinking about AI, machine learning, data integration, drone tech, inspection technologies, things of that nature. From our vantage it’s important to place a few different bets at the same time. Working with an accelerator like Alchemist can give us a learning entry-point to see what is out there.”

Industrial companies have a critical tool at hand to mitigate risk and reduce costs from unexpected downtime: data. But in today’s digital world, oftentimes these organizations find themselves faced with too much data to make sense of. By the year 2020, data production will reach an all-time high — 44 times greater than it was in 2009. Think of it this way: when something like unplanned downtime in an automotive plant can cost $22,000 per minute, industrial engineers often hone in on the data that only provides red flags to avoid incidents in the first place. As a result, they overlook other critical data in the process, losing out on opportunities to save money in the long term. This unused data — also known as “dark data” — has the potential to improve operations and significantly reduce costs. But where can dark data benefit industrial organizations the most?

An online tool to track the use of bio-based raw materials in products has been launched as a pilot by AkzoNobel, Advanced Biochemical and EY. The partners say it will be the first tool ever to use e-certification to track bio-based content along the value chain. Many chemicals can be made either from fossil feedstock or bio-based raw materials, such as vegetable oils or sugars, but it is difficult to verify how much of each has been used. The new tool aims to solve this problem by verifying exactly how much of a product is made from bio-based raw materials. This will make it easier for producers to choose more sustainable products and move towards a more circular economy, the companies say.

Refineries explore IIoT tools to maximize profits. To strengthen their chances of success, refiners are increasingly exploring digital tools that take advantage of the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), as well as advanced software for data analysis that can optimize process operations and reduce downtime. The historical approach to refinery operation has largely been characterized by a “run to fail” mentality, where abnormal conditions and malfunctions were detected only when alarms arose or when a component broke or failed. The IIoT enables operators, engineers and plant managers to capture and analyze data so they can predictively identify potential issues before problems arise. A plant enabled by IIoT is equipped with a combination of sensors, automation systems and cloud-based technologies that are integrated with its current systems and data analytics capabilities. Streaming data from sensors and instruments allow plants to quickly assess current conditions and identify warning signs for abnormal operations. Beyond that, digital tools that enable plants to access the benefits of the IIoT and cloud computing are becoming instruments for boosting profitability.

New test method aims to predict allergenic potency of chemicals. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden have developed a method which determines not only whether a chemical or substance is allergenic, but also how strong its potential for causing hypersensitivity is. This will aid in the establishment of so-called threshold values -- or how much of a substance is safe to use in a product. Until now, the only way of achieving similar results has been through animal testing.

On Sept. 9, 2010, a short circuit caused the operations room to read a valve as open when it had actually closed, spiking the readings coming from pipeline pressure sensors in different parts of the system...The accident investigation report blamed the disaster on a sub-standard segment of pipe and technical errors; there was no suggestion that the software error was intentional, no indication that malicious actors were involved. “But that’s just the point,” Joe Weiss argues. “The Internet of Things introduces new vulnerabilities even without malicious actors.”

Machine learning approach could aid the design of industrial processes for drug manufacturing. When organic chemists identify a useful chemical compound—a new drug, for instance—it's up to chemical engineers to determine how to mass-produce it. There could be 100 different sequences of reactions that yield the same end product. But some of them use cheaper reagents and lower temperatures than others, and perhaps most importantly, some are much easier to run continuously, with technicians occasionally topping up reagents in different reaction chambers. Historically, determining the most efficient and cost-effective way to produce a given molecule has been as much art as science. But MIT researchers are trying to put this process on a more secure empirical footing, with a computer system that's trained on thousands of examples of experimental reactions and that learns to predict what a reaction's major products will be. https://phys.org/news/2017-06-machine-approach-aid-industrial-drug.html

It has tended towards a savings mentality, choosing to focus on reactive cost-cutting, rather than being proactive and boxing clever with predictive analytics to monitor spend and add value...Technology has often been viewed with much suspicion by procurement departments. The fear was that automation such as e-procurement would bring about a race to the bottom, focusing on price at the expense of other factors in the supply chain – and at the expense of the employees in procurement.

3D Printed sensors could offer earlier warning of wildfires and chemical leaks.
A forest fire can spread unbelievably fast, which means that early detection is critical. The current systems in place for detecting the spread of forest fires, however, aren’t perfect. Watch towers, satellites and costly fixed sensors are the standard at the moment, but a group of researchers from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have developed a new, better method that involves a series of inexpensive, disposable 3D printed sensors wirelessly linked to a few fixed nodes. The system is designed to detect not only fires, but industrial chemical leaks that can pose a threat to public health. The sensors can detect heat and lowered humidity, which signify a forest fire, as well as the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. Dispersed over a large area, the sensors would communicate with a few larger, fixed nodes, wirelessly transmitting the data in a lifesaving Internet of Things application.

Smart factory: GE Aviation. What GE Aviation calls its “automation journey” took flight in the late 1990s as the Japanese principles of kaizen (continuous improvement) and lean (waste reduction) took root in North American manufacturing. For Bromont, robots also help to solve critical health and safety problems, especially for workers sweltering in repetitive and hazardous forging processes.“We did a lot of kaizen activities, we leaned out the processes, and it became evident that we had opportunities for automation,” Ouellette explained. “And then people started asking for robots. That was the great thing. They said, ‘Have you thought of putting a robot here?’ It has just snowballed since the late ’90s.” Today, the facility features over 150 robots performing a variety of forging, forming, testing and inspection processes. And poor safety ratings, which hampered the company’s performance two decades ago, have been replaced by best-in-class practices.

BASF applies blockchain to its supply chain. Supply chains are complex. They present problems. For example, how can one recognize a delivery is incomplete or damaged, even before you receive it? Start-up Quantoz – in combination with BASF and a second start-up, Ahrma – identified a ‘smart answer’ to this question. Use an intelligent pallet (from Ahrma) which provides information about its position and movement, loading status and possible impacts (like being dropped). Intelligent pallets, whether with missing or damaged parts, enable automatic reordering. By using Quantoz’s blockchain technology, the security and trust in the data integrity increases. Furthermore, this combination should offer a secure and transparent material and data flow in the future. The current work remains a pilot. If successful it will reach a broad audience for BASF is a global company.

Factories of the future need AI to survive and compete. Since the industrial revolution, factories have been optimized to mass produce a few products rapidly and cheaply to satisfy global demand. “The largest inefficiency that most manufacturers face is inflexibility,” says Jim Lawton, Chief Product and Marketing Officer of Rethink Robotics, maker of collaborative industrial robots. “Traditional industrial automation requires hundreds of hours to reprogram, making it very impractical to change how the task is performed.” Catering to finicky consumers is not the only challenge confronting modern factories. Costs of production in traditionally affordable countries like China and Mexico are rising. Oil and gas industries have been hit incredibly hard by historically low oil prices, driving the need for further efficiencies and cost reduction. In virtually all factories, poor demand forecasting and capacity planning, unexpected equipment failures and downtimes, supply chain bottlenecks, and inefficient or unsafe workplace processes can lead to resource wastage, longer production periods, low yields on production inputs, and lost revenue.

Edge computing: a competing view. A prominent topic lately associated with Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been that of edge computing. As Wikipedia explains it, edge computing is “optimizing cloud computing systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of the data.” Another term used for this is fog computing. But is this really a new concept in the field of industrial automation? And if so, what is really changing? Historically, control at the edge has been done with a programmable logic controller (PLC) or distributed control system (DCS). Considering this, until the emergence of these new terms around IIoT a few years ago, what exactly was a PLC at the edge of? A cliff? A knife? Ok, maybe field networks, yes. So, until recently, “edge” terminology didn’t even make any sense. But now, information technology (IT) networks are being connected to operation technology (OT) networks, thereby putting OT controllers at the edge—from the perspective of IT.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
B2B Customer Experience Still Requires a Human Touch. While “digital customer experiences” are obviously important, human interactions still play a vital role in customer experience delivery, particularly for B2B companies. In fact, recent research indicates that business customers highly value the human component of the customer experience. Earlier this year, KPMG Nunwood Consulting published a report discussing several important aspects of B2B customer experience. The report was based on a survey of 2,974 members of decision making units in B2B companies. Survey respondents included end Users, Influencers, and Decision Makers, and all were located in the US or the UK. Not surprisingly, the research found that customer experience plays a vital role in competitive success. Three-fourths of the survey respondents considered customer experience as a major factor in supplier choice. The research identified six “pillars” that describe the psychology of customer experience, and the report argues that the key to customer experience success is preparing for the critical “moments that matter” across a customer’s life cycle.

Investment in innovation pays off for DuPont's agriculture unit. DuPont has completely shifted its research and development model. The company is actually spending less on research than it did in the past. DuPont invested about $1.6 billion in research last year, down from $1.8 billion in 2015 and $2 billion in 2014. But that spending is now more targeted. DuPont has tied research spending to customer needs to ensure there is a demand for what it creates. The research and development spending of each unit is much more closely tied to their individual markets. "We've been shifting our innovation strategy inside DuPont with respect to how we develop new products," said Randal King, technology director, DuPont Electronics & Communications.

Can bots really deliver great customer experience? A number of brands are – quite rightly – harnessing the power of technology to streamline both their operational and strategic communications activities. But when it comes to the customer experience (CX), can bots truly satisfy expectations, or is the growing tendency to integrate AI actually putting the CX at risk? Given the impact of the customer experience on a brand’s revenue, reputation and advocacy levels, very few savvy B2B marketers would overlook the need to integrate CX objectives into their activities. But as the number of channels and touchpoints within every individual’s journey continues to rise, so too does the scale of the CX challenge. This may go some way to explaining why, unfortunately, B2B customer-experience index ratings lag significantly behind those of retail customers. After all, we continuously read about outstanding examples of B2C CX champions such as AO.com, Halifax Bank and Virgin. But B2B brands fail to receive the same level of praise.

Drones take to the skies in the chemical processing industries. There is no doubt that drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hold many promising opportunities for the chemical process industries (CPI), although, as with any new technology, some challenges may arise. “We’re just starting to see some of the larger chemical manufacturers begin to use drone technology,” says Bill Erny, senior director of security, regulatory and technical affairs at the American Chemistry Council. Equipment inspection, says Erny, is currently the most promising application for drones in the CPI. “Some equipment is challenging to access, such as flare stacks, large processing vessels and things of that nature,” he explains. Some drones can actually fly inside equipment structures and execute visual inspections, or even non-destructive testing (NDT), eliminating the need for confined-space entry. Although equipment inspection is currently the most commonly seen application for drones in CPI plants, several other tasks have emerged where their use might be beneficial, including emergency response, security management, site surveys and environmental remediation.

How machine learning enhances the value of industrial internet of things. Cloud computing has been the biggest enabler of connected devices and enterprise IoT. Cheaper storage combined with ample computing power is the key driver behind the rise of IIoT. Though it was possible to capture data from various sensors and devices, customers found it prohibitively expensive to store massive datasets. Even after sufficient storage resources were allocated, the computing horse power required to process, query and analyze these datasets was missing in the enterprise data center. Much of the available resources were allocated to data warehouses and business intelligence systems that are critical to businesses. The acceptance of cloud as an extended data center changed the equation. Industry verticals such as manufacturing, automobile, healthcare and aviation are now capturing every possible data point generated by the sensors. They are taking advantage of cloud storage, Big Data and Big Compute capabilities offered by large public cloud providers. This has been the single most important factor in accelerating IIoT adoption in enterprises.

How to connect a digital, data-driven smart factory. The Industrial Internet Consortium describes a smart factory as the ability to “aggregate, analyze and act on data.” Aggregate, analyze and act are not, unfortunately, as distinct or delineated as they might seem. Aggregating data at the factory floor typically includes some analyzing and displaying, and that results in some acting by the end user. But there is still plenty to be done at the enterprise and cloud level for analyzing and acting. This blog focuses on aggregating on the factory floor. In a perfect world, an industrial facility is a new, greenfield plant built with the sensors, controllers, networks and computers required to meet the end user’s desires for information. In the real world, an old, brownfield plant is the norm. There are machines, cells of machines and processes that are not connected to anything—they are islands of production with little connectedness. Clipboards might still be used to collect data.

DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN
Blockchain in the supply chain: too much hype. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.  Blockchain is a protocol for a digital ledger that enables proof of ownership and the transfer of ownership from one entity to another without using a trusted third party intermediary (like a bank).  The value that is transferred can also move through an extended supply chain while ensuring that what occurs at each point in the chain can be chronologically recorded. In logistics, the best known blockchain pilot program involved Maersk and IBM. It centered on creating a digital distributed ledger to create a single electronic place where all the myriad documents related to a shipment could be housed. In one projected pilot by a company called T-Mining, the blockchain will give clearance for personnel – like a truck driver – to pick up a load. One of the key advantages of blockchain is that it is much, much more secure than traditional IT solutions.

Now that this technology has been embedded in the total Software AG portfolio, Cumulocity IoT is said to offer ‘self-service’ IoT software to enable organizations to develop their own IoT applications. In terms of deployment, the Cumulocity IoT portfolio operates at the edge (for on- or near-device ‘edge’ computing), either on the cloud or in on-premise mode. This breadth is claimed by the company to allow more choice when designing, building, deploying and upgrading enterprise IoT applications and services.

Quantum computing goes beyond hydrogen and helium. Quantum computers could be the future of computational chemistry if they can calculate properties of molecules that conventional digital computers can’t handle. Today’s quantum systems are a long way from reaching that goal. But a quantum computer at IBM just passed a milestone: It performed the first calculations involving molecules containing more than just hydrogen and helium. Digital computers crunch numbers to describe properties such as a molecule’s ground-state energy by using the Schrödinger equation to calculate mathematical parameters called wave functions. However, digital computers can solve such problems exactly only for elementary molecules because of the great complexity of the many interactions of the multiple subatomic particles found in larger compounds.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Getting better analytics and insights from your collected customer data. Data collection and analytics are tightly coupled. The mistake we see made over and over again is that companies tend to focus their customer data collection efforts with a single objective (or a single program) in mind. This treats the data collected as a short-term objective, not as a long-term asset. Over time, this results in data islands that eventually "go dark" given that no one is managing customer data as part of an explicit long-term effort. When it comes to customer data, a long-term data collection strategy almost always proves critical for any advanced analytical work that leads to meaningful business outcomes that can optimize (i.e., simulation management, condition-based maintenance, predictive maintenance and digital twins). Trending analysis, predicting behavior and customer profiling all benefit from long-term data collection strategies.

Digitalization comes to the materials industry. “There is a lot of excitement about the potential of digital,” McKinsey proclaims. It goes on to define digital as an “umbrella term for all the digital-related topics, including new or enhanced ways of operating businesses by using data, analytics, and new digitally enabled technologies, communications, and platforms.” But hasn’t the chemical industry long been a digital leader, installing advanced financial management software and spending billions of dollars preparing for the shock of Y2K? Aren’t plants and laboratories today highly automated, filled with the latest computers? There wouldn’t appear to be much chance for IT excitement in chemicals. Yet enthusiasm for digital as the “next big thing” is borne out in recent announcements by BASF, Dow Chemical, Evonik Industries, and others that describe partnerships with computer giants such as IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

IBM just simulated chemistry with a quantum computer. IBM scientists have managed to pull a record-breaking molecule simulation using a quantum processor, opening new promising paths to chemistry and materials science. When chemists conduct experiments, they sometimes have to manipulate all kinds of materials that are more or less hazardous, or rare and expensive, and they have to be precise to ensure that no foreign element or unknown parameter would compromise the results. Once the reaction is launched, they will have to take different measurements during the whole experiment, which can take days or even weeks. Computer simulations of chemical reactions are thus of great help as a tool, especially with the growth in computing power.

Manufacturers are convinced the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) will help them improve operations and profitability by 10% or more, but most are struggling to develop the right plans to take advantage of the technology, according to a new IndustryWeek survey sponsored by Emerson. The survey revealed that about 60% are exploring or investing in Industrial IoT pilot projects, but only 5% are investing against a clear business case for how to best implement the technology. The vast majority of Industrial IoT investment today is in the early stages of plan development and small-scale trials, often as part of a larger operational efficiency programme. The survey found the biggest challenges for operational efficiency programmes are company culture (47%); lack of clear business strategy (41%); and knowing which technology will deliver measurable improvement (34%).

Supply chain’s future rests in the cloud. The accelerated demand of consumers mandates that businesses need to ensure their supply chains can keep pace and continue to stay competitive. Yet, disconnected legacy systems are inhibiting retail and manufacturing companies from quickly adopting technology solutions to address the needs of modern business. To transition legacy systems to a more modern approach, businesses should look to cloud-based management solutions to integrate all areas of supply chain, both internal and external, to gather real-time data and enable a more holistic view into the supply chain. Emerging technology devices and systems can help bring together supply chain planning, manufacturing and maintenance and provide the necessary insights to properly manage across the entire system. For example, utilizing IoT enabled cloud technology can provide real-time visibility to machines operating in various production lines in different locations, and inform managers about the most productive locations and associated performance details. This gives managers insight to connect and streamline processes across multiple locations for more effective production.

Manufacturing in this new era of machine learning requires little human intervention, transitioning from an input and output approach to a fluid conversation between humans and robots. In the manufacturing space, IoT technology is a crucial enabler for predictive maintenance. Through the use of IoT sensors, smart factories are coming to life, with connected machines that can communicate with each other and with humans, who can take action when necessary. This technology can catch changes and faults that are unseen by the human eye. Instead of solving a problem after it happens, predictive maintenance will alert the system ahead of time, so humans (or machines) can take the necessary action to ensure no problem occurs at all.

Smart factories: the future of manufacturing. A new study from Capgemini, says 76% of manufacturers either have an ongoing smart factory initiative or are working on formulating one. More than half of them, the study says, have designated $100 million or more toward smart factories. It estimates the smart factories could add $500 billion to $1.5 trillion in value-added to the global economy in five years. These manufacturers predict overall efficiency will grow annually to 2022 at seven times the rate of growth since 1990. Chemical giant BASF incorporated a smart factory system in Kaiserslautern, Germany, to manufacture fully customizable soaps and shampoos. When an order is placed, the automated factory line adjusts its protocols to make the product and packaging as ordered by the customer. Radio-frequency ID tags attached to the soap containers send wireless signals that tell the machines on the production line about the customized order.

Chemical firms plunge into 3-D printing. Polymer companies including Arkema, DSM, Lubrizol, and Perstorp are deepening their commitment to three-dimensional printing. They are betting that increasing the number of materials available for the technology will help it take off in manufacturing. DSM has established a new business, DSM Additive Manufacturing, as part of an effort to broaden its 3-D printing business beyond stereolithography (SLA), a process that uses lasers to trace parts out of a vat of photopolymer. A leader in that sector for decades, DSM now aims to sell polymers for other 3-D printing techniques, including fused filament fabrication (FFF), in which a machine draws parts layer by layer with melted resin. The company also acquired a materials development kit from the printer giant HP, which is developing a high-speed 3-D printing technology it calls Multi Jet Fusion. The kit will allow DSM to test the compatibility of its resins with HP’s process. Dow Chemical also acquired a toolkit. Materials, HP argues, are essential to the success of 3-D printing. Ramon Pastor, general manager of Multi Jet Fusion at HP, points out that thousands of materials are available for conventional “analog” processes such as injection molding. “3-D printing will need to develop just as many,” he says.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Customer experience is the new battleground for B2B businesses.Great customer experience and satisfaction has played a pivotal role in retaining existing customers and getting new ones through reference. In comparison to the B2C world, the way B2B looks at customer experience management is a lot different as the loss of a customer, especially because of customer service, can prove to be catastrophic for a firm. It is important for an enterprise to make sure that they are solving all major pain points of their customers, and periodically take surveys to understand the patterns of the prospective customers. Besides, it is very important to follow an apt communication channel to connect with customers and educate them from time to time. Here are a few points that will help enterprises to take customer experience strategy one step higher: (i) Content marketing holds the key (ii) Getting the right staff and providing the right training (iii) Give customer service top priority in the customer lifecycle (iv) Deliver a effortless experience to customers.

Cyber security startup raises $10m to help protect industrial internet systems. As connected devices find their way into large-scale industrial applications – what’s often called IIoT, or Industrial Internet of Things – the need to safeguard those networks becomes more imperative. If you’re, say, a large automotive company running a bunch of manufacturing plants, you really don’t want your connected systems hijacked by hackers or compromised by employee errors. Tel Aviv-based ScadaFence is a cyber security startup that tackles this specific challenge – shielding industrial networks from cyber attacks and threats. The company just announced its series A round, raising US$10 million. Investors include JVP, NexStar Partners, 31Ventures Global Innovation Fund, Global Brain’s GB-VI Growth Fund, iAngels, and DS Strategic Partners. The funds will be used to grow the company’s research and development center in Tel Aviv and boost its global business teams to address “growing demand” from its clients in the US, Europe, and Asia.

From theory to reality – powering up industry 4.0. One of our first challenges is in accepting that robots and so-called Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have arrived for real. We are now learning the part that these machines and software systems can play in the way all organisations now refine and finesse their business models. The opportunities here are both massive and diverse, which means that this new realignment of industry will take some time to fully engineer and fully exploit for positive gain. In the Industry 4.0 era we see that firms will now be structured around a deeper core of system interoperability and information transparency, which in itself will enable a new era of decentralised decision making. There is a liberation factor here and it works in a positive virtuous circle. That is, as we humans start to understand when and where we can apply RPA, we can further tune our workflows to be even more efficient. In this new environment of information clarity and data analytics-empowered efficiency we can now free up our human workforce from repetitive tasks that can be specifically codified for machine brains to execute.

Time is ripe for chemical industry to grasp digitisation - Accenture. The chemical industry is gradually becoming aware of the benefits that digitisation can offer in terms of efficiency and cost savings, but it will take a leap of faith to move from awareness to spending money and being prepared to alter business processes. Consultants at Accenture are so convinced that the age of digitisation is upon us that they have launched a new practice known as Industry X.0 aimed at helping companies tap into new technologies. The group claims that the average chemical company could boost market capitalisation by more than $4.4bn through adoption of an optimum combination of new technologies. They also estimate cost savings of $91,261 per employee are achievable. Pete Frandina, North America Industry X.0 lead, said to ICIS that technologies need to be combined and not seen in isolation to get the maximum benefits.Remote monitoring and communication between employees on sites can help with allocation of resources as well as safety and protection.

DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN
Manufacturers falling behind in take-up of digital supply chain networks. Only 29% of manufacturers admit to truly understanding what having a Digital Supply Chain Network (DSN) is, with under 15% implementing a DSN and expecting them to become the norm for the business in the next five years, according to a new study. The findings are part of a report by Sapio Research on behalf of Zetes which found that the biggest challenges to adoption is a lack of information visibility, which in-turn damages the chances of an organisation being able to access relevant insight in real-time. At present, manufacturers state securing meaningful intelligence from their end-to-end supply chain as a challenge (80%), dealing with-real time information (75%) and the ability to deal with the intelligence – as significant hurdles that need to be overcome. The fact that over two thirds of manufacturers cannot provide decision makers with access to the information required to make informed business decisions, is of significant concern. Although 89% of manufacturers state that they believe that a single view of information from supply chain operations is key – to date, only 30% have full end-to-end visibility.

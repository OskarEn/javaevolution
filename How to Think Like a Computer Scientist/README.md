# javaevolution
This is quite messsy and is for personal use right now to help me gain some sense of achievement. Hoping to see a nice progression in what I am able to pull together.
Will be guided through my learning with the courses "Introduction to Java and OOP" and "Graphical object-orientated and Internet programming in Java". The accompanying study guides for these are what I base the Ch folders on but solutions are usually a few steps above what is asked. In addition I will be taking exercises from Allen B. Downey's "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" that correspond with the chapter layouts in the textbook.
Feel free to comment/follow me/add me on linkedin.
If there is anyone from #University of London - Goldsmiths in the course "Computing and Information Systems"# then welcome to my little project page! Please ask me for a slack invitation if you are not part of the group yet
